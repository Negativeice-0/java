Learning java with labex.io
I must say, the journey of a thousand miles surely starts with just one step. It's been weeks of agonsising pain, trying to figure out how what path to choose in terms of my Information Technology journey, which programming language to perfect on and what education yo persue with a balance of providing employability and skill development.
I eventually settled on JetBrains: Intellij IDE community edition. I was strugling between netbeans, eclipse and visual studio before realising their community edition is also opensource.
I made this repositroy so I can prove my experience in java development as opposed to just rumbling and raving about all I have done.
