Learning java with labex.io
I must say, the journey of a thousand miles surely starts with just one step. It's been weeks of agonsising pain, trying to figure out how what path to choose in terms of my Information Technology journey, which programming language to perfect on and what education yo persue with a balance of providing employability and skill development.
I eventually settled on JetBrains: Intellij IDE community edition. I was strugling between netbeans, eclipse and visual studio before realising their community edition is also opensource.
I made this repositroy so I can prove my experience in java development as opposed to just rumbling and raving about all I have done.
Notice, shell commands are not represented as I don't think posting how to create a file with the touch command is relevant. I believe it is common knowledge.
Compiling a java source code (aka java byte code, the file with the .java extension) to a java class file (binary the computer understands) using the javc command is as follows (javac Hello.java).
Running the compiled java class == java Hello.
Others you will just have to do your own research cause they really are not that hard to figure out, a few youtube videos will show you how to git commit and what not. 
Other more important commands like shell scripting will only be used for automation and large file handling which is pretty advanced any company will attach a senior developer to you to show you whuch commands the company prefers, don't even stress about it.
