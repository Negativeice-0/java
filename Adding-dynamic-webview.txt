If you can't see the Dynamic Web Project option in Eclipse, it's likely that you're missing the necessary plugins for Java EE development.
Here's how you can add them:

1. Open Eclipse and go to `Help -> Install New Software`.
2. Click the down arrow available in the `Work with` field and select the link corresponding to your version of Eclipse 
(for example, for Eclipse Kepler, the link would be `http://download.eclipse.org/releases/kepler`⁴).
3. Now select the checkbox with the name `Web, XML, Java EE and OSGi Enterprise Development`¹.
4. Click `Next -> Next -> Accept` the license requirement -> `Finish`.
5. Wait for some time till the plugins get downloaded.
6. Restart Eclipse and now go to `File -> New -> Other -> Web`, and you should see the `Dynamic Web Project` option¹.

Please note that the URL in the `Work with` field depends on your version of Eclipse. For example, for Eclipse Oxygen, the URL would be `http://download.eclipse.org/releases/oxygen/`¹.

If you're still facing issues, you might want to consider reinstalling Eclipse and choosing the "Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers" version, which contains everything you need to create a Dynamic Web Project¹.
