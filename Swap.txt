Certainly! Let's swap the values of the variables **a** and **b** without introducing any new variables. Here are a few methods to achieve this:

1. **Using Addition and Subtraction**:
   - We can add **a** and **b** to get a new value for **a**, then subtract the original **b** from this sum to get the new value for **b**.
   - Here's the code snippet:
     ```cpp
     int a = 5, b = 8;
     a = a + b;
     b = a - b;
     a = a - b;
     ```
   - After swapping, **a** will be 8, and **b** will be 5.

2. **Using Bitwise XOR (Exclusive OR)**:
   - The bitwise XOR operator can be used to swap two variables. It returns a number with all bits set to 1 wherever the bits of **a** and **b** differ.
   - Here's the code snippet:
     ```cpp
     int a = 5, b = 8;
     a = a ^ b;
     b = a ^ b;
     a = a ^ b;
     ```
   - After swapping, **a** will be 8, and **b** will be 5.

3. **Using Multiplication and Division** (Note: Be cautious with this method):
   - Multiply **a** and **b** to get a new value for **a**, then divide the original **a** by the new **b** to get the new value for **b**.
   - Here's the code snippet:
     ```cpp
     int a = 5, b = 8;
     a = a * b;
     b = a / b;
     a = a / b;
     ```
   - After swapping, **a** will be 8, and **b** will be 5.

Remember that these methods work well for integers, but there are some limitations and potential issues (such as overflow) with certain values. Choose the method that best suits your needs! ðŸš€
